NAME
    Apache::AntiSpam - AntiSpam filter for web pages

SYNOPSIS
      # in httpd.conf
      <Location /antispam>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlHandler Apache::AntiSpam
      </Location>

      # off course, filter aware!
      PerlModule Apache::Filter
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlSetVar Filter On
      PerlHandler Apache::RegistryFilter Apache::AntiSpam Apache::Compress

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::AntiSpam is a filter module to prevent e-mail addresses exposed
    as is on web pages. This module replaces e-mail addresses in web pages
    with one of the formats listed below. (you can choose one)

    *   miyagawa-nospam@cpan.org

    *   miyagawa at cpan dot org

    This module is Filter aware, meaning that it can work within
    Apache::Filter framework without modification.

CONFIGURATION
      # choose either of two
      PerlSetVar AntiSpamFormat NoSpam
      PerlSetVar AntiSpamFormat Spaces

    "AntiSpamFormat" indicates the way Apache::AntiSpam replaces the e-mail
    addresses.

    "NoSpam"
        replaces miyagawa@cpan.org with miyagawa-nospam@cpan.org. (default)

    "Spaces"
        replaces miyagawa@cpan.org with miyagawa at cpan dot org.

TODO
    *   -nospam suffix should be configured (easy).

    *   More logging with Apache::Log.

    *   remove mailto: tags using HTML::Parser.

    *   Make it easy to subclass so can be configured address munging.

CAVEATS
    Email::Find 0.0[23] may take up to half-an-hour or so to extract emails
    in complex documents, which can't be used for this kind of usage. (You
    can't wait for an hour in front of the browser!)

    Thus, Apache::Antispam localizes regex used by find_email() to more
    speedy version if Email::Find's VERSION is lower than 0.03.

    Email::Find 0.04, which Michael G Schwern is now working on, will solve
    this problem of parsing speed.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    The idea of this module is stolen from Apache::AddrMunge by Mark J
    Dominus. See http://perl.plover.com/AddrMunge/ for details.
