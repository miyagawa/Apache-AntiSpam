DESCRIPTION
    Apache::AntiSpam is a filter module to prevent e-mail addresses exposed
    as is on web pages. This module replaces e-mail addresses in web pages
    with one of the formats listed below. (you can choose one)

    *   miyagawa-nospam@cpan.org

    *   miyagawa at cpan dot org

    This module is Filter aware, meaning that it can work within
    Apache::Filter framework without modification.

CONFIGURATION
      # choose either of two
      PerlSetVar AntiSpamFormat NoSpam
      PerlSetVar AntiSpamFormat Spaces

    "AntiSpamFormat" indicates the way Apache::AntiSpam replaces the e-mail
    addresses.

    "NoSpam"
        replaces miyagawa@cpan.org with miyagawa-nospam@cpan.org. (default)

    "Spaces"
        replaces miyagawa@cpan.org with miyagawa at cpan dot org.

TODO
    *   -nospam suffix should be configured (easy).

    *   More logging with Apache::Log.

    *   remove mailto: tags using HTML::Parser.

    *   Make it easy to subclass so that the antispamming method can be
        configured.
